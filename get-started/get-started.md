# Get started

This page allows you to build, flash, run, and control your very first Luos code.

This section is separated in 3 parts:

1.  [**Part 1: Your first Luos service**](/get-started/get-started1): the embedded part, where you will have all the tools you need to easily develop using Luos in your embedded target.
2.  [**Part 2: Take the control**](/get-started/get-started2): the remote control part, where you will have all the tools you need to take control and easily test any Luos device.
3.  [**Part 3: Unleash your code**](/get-started/get-started3): the last part, where you will create your first Luos network allowing you to deal with a multiple-boards system.

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need to install dependancies such as <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python<IconExternalLink width="10" /></a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT<IconExternalLink width="10" /></a>, <a href="https://ipython.org/" target="_blank">Ipython<IconExternalLink width="10" /></a>, and a USB driver compatible with your board. Although the purpose of this tutorial is not to guide you through the installation of these dependancies, we will recommand some links to help you along the process.
