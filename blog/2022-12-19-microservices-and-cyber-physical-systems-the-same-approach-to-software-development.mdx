![Microservices and cyber-physical systems: the same approach to software development](/assets/images/blog/microservices-and-cps-the-same-approach-to-software-development-luos.png)

Microservices and cyber-physical systems are flagged as two different approaches to developing respectively software or hardware driven by software.

While microservices are often used for building large and complex software applications, cyber-physical systems are typically used for building software systems embedded in physical devices and with a direct impact on the physical world. 

Despite their differences, microservices and cyber-physical systems are based on the same underlying principles and offer developers many of the same benefits and challenges.

<h2>The similarities between the microservices and CPS</h2>

A key similarity between **microservices** and **cyber-physical systems** is their focus on **modularity** and flexibility. 

In both cases, developers divide the system into **smaller**, **independent units** of code that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently from each other. This modular approach makes it possible to create systems that are flexible and can be easily updated and extended over time.

Another similarity between a microservices architecture and cyber-physical systems is their reliance on communication and collaboration. In both cases, the individual units of code need to be able to communicate and share data to function properly.

This requires the use of well-defined communication protocols and APIs, often involving collaboration between different teams and departments.

<h2>The benefits and challenges of using microservices for cyber-physical systems</h2>

One of the key benefits of using microservices and cyber-physical systems is their ability to support [scalability](/docs/luos-technology#good-practices-with-luos) and resilience. 

> By dividing the system into smaller code units, developers can create systems that can scale up and down based on demand and continue to function even if individual units fail or are taken offline for maintenance.

One of the main challenges of using microservices and [cyber-physical systems](/blog/cyber-physical-systems) is the complexity of the systems that they create. 

Because the system is divided into many small code units, it cannot be easy to manage and maintain the system as a whole. This often requires the use of specialized tools and techniques, which can require significant coordination and collaboration between different teams and departments.

The streaming service **Netflix** massively used microservices. This method allows them to manage the constraints of **scalability**, quality, and robustness of their service. 

We have the same kind of constraints on cars, especially today with autonomous vehicles that must deal with a large amount of sensor data. Cars are also driven by software. 

The only difference is the industrial environment and normalization that change how the tools need to work. In the end, the microservice architecture strategy used by Netflix can also be applied to a car to improve scalability, quality, and robustness.
The only difference will be the tools and implementation to achieve it.

<h2>Let's conclude</h2>

In conclusion, a microservices architecture and cyber-physical systems are similar in many ways, and they both offer benefits and challenges for software developers.

By using modular and flexible approaches to software development, **microservices** and **cyber-physical systems** can help organizations create complex systems that are scalable, maintainable, and resilient.
