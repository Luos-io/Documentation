ðŸ†• Luos feature in the V2.0.0: the open-source bootloader

<!--truncate-->

This feature is the big new one everyone has asked us for years. Now, you can compile Luos in bootloader mode. By compiling it this way, you can flash it to your board then use the Luos embedded network through a gate to update your board firmware.

This allows you to update any board/firmware anywhere on your device without having physical access to it.
