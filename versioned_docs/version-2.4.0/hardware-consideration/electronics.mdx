# Integrating Luos engine into an electronic board

To create and match with a default reference design, electronic boards must respect some design rules to work in a Luos network properly.

## Electronic design

A Luos-friendly electronic board must contain _at least_ the following elements:

- **1 microcontroller unit (MCU)**: It hosts, as a node, the Luos engine based firmware along with the different <Tooltip def={customFields.service_def} >services</Tooltip> (drivers and apps).
- **At least two connectors** (only for wired networks): They allow to link boards together into a Luos network and link them as a daisy-chain or star mounting. Through PTP pins, the nodes know if there is another node connected to the connector. This is used when the user wants to make a topology detection of the system.
