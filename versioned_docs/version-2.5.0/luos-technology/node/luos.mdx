# Luos engine

The node's embedded code hosts the Luos engine's embedded code and the node's functionalities, stored in services. Luos engine is responsible for creating each node's identity, integrating the node to a network, locating it among the other nodes, communicating with each other, and managing all their services.

## Luos engine integration

Luos engine works as a code library running on nodes. It can use several network interfaces.

To match the Luos engine's library with your hardware, it offers an _Hardware Abstraction Layer_ for various devices in the <Tooltip def={customFields.luoshal_def}>Luos engine's HAL folder</Tooltip>.
There is also specific _Hardware Abstraction Layers_ for each network layer.

  </a>
  : The main library you will be working with.

To make it work in your environment, you have to:

- Include the Luos engine's library folders in your project compilation;
- Include the right HAL for your device family;
- If necessary, overload HAL default configuration with a _node_config.h_ file describing specificities of your node. Luos engine's HAL provides default configurations for MCU families as examples, they can be modified to fit with your design (e.g. match pins with your design);
- Include _luos_engine.h_ in your main file.

The Luos engine's loop function needs to run constantly on each node.

The engine is like a task that has to be run regularly. The primary Luos engine's functions that should be called to be integrated into the embedded code of a node are `Luos_init()` and `Luos_loop()`. They should be added in the `main()` of your program.

Basically, your `main()` function will look like this:

```c
#include "luos_engine.h"

int main(void)
{
    Luos_Init();
    while(1)
    {
        Luos_Loop();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Adding this code to a <Tooltip def={customFields.node_def}>node</Tooltip> makes it able to react to a Luos network. It is now ready to host your services by [running packages](../package) on your main.

**As a developer, you will always develop your functionalities into services and never into the `main()` program.**

:::note
The only information that should be put on the `main()` code are MCU's setup parameters and services' run functions.
:::

## A complete software node view

At the node level, communication is achieved by receiving and sending [messages](../message) with the other [services](../services) of a Luos network. The nodes can communicate with each other thanks to the network layer.

Luos engine will be able to find the physical destination to reach a specific service and define the best way to make it (basically using localhost or using the network layer).

:::info
If you use Luos engine on only one board, you don't need to take care of the physical network, the engine will only use localhost. You can use it to deal with microservice developpement on IOT, for example.
:::

Robus executes a format control, and stores messages in the `msg_buffer` of your node. Depending on the specified destination and the type of each message, they are either treated automatically by Robus and Luos engine or sent to one or several [services](../services).

## Node Parameters Configuration

Luos engine allows you to configure some parameters to optimize the memory usage and adapt it to fit your needs. To make it, we advise using a configuration file called _node_config.h_. Put the file at the root folder of your node project and add it in the compiling variables section of your IDE by adding the following line:

`#include node_config.h`

You can use it to set all your custom configurations:

- for the services of your node
- for the Luos engine of your node
- to modify HAL configurations to fit your design

|     Parameters     |    Defaults value     |                                                    Description                                                     |
| :----------------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   NBR_NAK_RETRY    |          10           |                                  Number of retries to send after a received NAK.                                   |
| MAX_SERVICE_NUMBER |           5           |                               Number of services in the node (memory optimization).                                |
|  MSG_BUFFER_SIZE   |      3\*size_msg      |         Message buffer size. Max size of a message (3 \* (7 bytes header + 128 bytes data + 2 bytes CRC)).         |
|     MAX_MSG_NB     | 2\*MAX_SERVICE_NUMBER |                               Max number of messages that can be referenced by Luos.                               |
|      NBR_PORT      |           2           | Number of PTP (port) on the node ( max 8). See [electronic design](../../hardware-consideration/electronics) page. |

You will find the default configuration for Luos engine in the file <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/blob/main/network/robus/inc/config.h" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">_config.h<IconExternalLink width="10"></IconExternalLink>_</a>.

Check the _Luos_hal_config.h_ and your _Network_hal_config.h_ of your MCU family to see parameters that can be changed to fit your design.

> **Note:** [Every example](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/tree/main/examples) provided by Luos has a _node_config.h_ file that can be used as a base to fit your project's needs.

## Luos Statistics

Into Luos embedded code, you are given the opportunity to obtain important information about different factors of the functioning of each node, as you can find stored several statistical values in the specific field of the structure that describes each node, like for example, the MCUs memory utilization, or timing information.

The statistics of a node can be occupied from any other node of the system, giving you the chance to explore the behavior of all your MCUs by having direct access to any of them.

More details of how to access the statistics are given in the [Monitoring tools page](../../tools/monitoring).
