# Luos Hardware Abstraction Layer

Luos engine can work on a single node using localhost communication or it can create a network for communication between services located on different nodes. This communication should be defined and hardware-configured to fit with the chosen MCU. The files _luos_hal.c_ and _luos_hal.h_ define all the functions needed by Luos engine. Then, there is a HAL depending on the network layer you use to send messages through the physical bus.

The file _luos_hal_config.h_ contains a default configuration for an MCU family and can be redefined in a configuration file to fit your design. The configuration of Luos engine HAL is described [here](/docs/hardware-consideration/mcu).

## Luos engine's HAL

Luos engine need some peripheral access to properly work:

- **TIMER**: Used for the systick and for the nanosecond precision timestamping of events.
- **FLASH**: Stores services' aliases in the system and writes your firmware on bootloader mode.

## Robus HAL

Robus is the default network layer used by Luos engine. Here is a list of all the hardware peripherals used to drive the physical bus:

- **PORT**: Defines necessary pins, PTP lines, Rx/Tx, enable/disable.
- **TIMER**: Defines timeouts for communication.
- **COM**: Serial bus.
- **CRC**: Optionaly used to optimize the messages validation. CRC can be generated through hardware or software.
- **DMA**: Optionaly used to optimize the communication.
