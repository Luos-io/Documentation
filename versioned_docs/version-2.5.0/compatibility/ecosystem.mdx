This page provides you with the different tools' compatibility information in the Luos ecosystem, and with the compatibility information between different versions of Luos engine in a same network.

# Ecosystem Compatibility

Luos provides several open source tools and API. Below is described the compatibility of Luos engine's versions with Luos HAL's and Pyluos' versions.

## How to read a compatibility table?

A compatibility table shows the compatibility of one version of a tool with other tools' versions. You read from left to right.

:::tip
Example:

|   Luos engine  |     Luos HAL      |       PYLUOS      |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| 2.0.0 | ≥ 0.4.0 | ≥ 2.0.0 <br /> < 2.0.2 | 

In this extract of a table, we can read that Luos engine 2.0.0 is compatible with Luos HAL 0.4.0 and upper versions, and with versions of Pyluos between 2.0.0 (included) and 2.0.2 (not included).

| 1.0.0 | ≥ 0.1.0 | ≥ 1.3.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 | 


# Network compatibility

In a same network, nodes can have different versions of Luos engine. The main rule is that all the minor versions in a same major version are compatible.

:::tip
For example, a node with the version 1.3.0 and a node with the version 1.2.0 are compatible because they have the same major version (in this example, version 1).
:::

:::warning
Despite this compatibility, some bugs may exist if you use different minor versions of a same major version. We advise you to use the same version of Luos engine in every nodes of a network.
