# Robus - Part 2: The topology management

Robus will rely on the unique ID distributed during the Luos engine's detection (`Node_ID`). Luos engine will need topological information to provide a unique ID during detection. Robus needs to be able to detect the nodes neighbors in the network and to share this information to Luos engine, allowing a proper topology detection.

## Topology detection using PTP lines

Robus uses wires called [PTP](/docs/next/luos-technology/node/topology#ptp-network) to poke the nodes neighbors and see if there is any.

The example below shows the process of assigning a node ID during the topology detection of three [nodes](/docs/next/luos-technology/node). The starting node always has the `node_ID` set to the value 1.

In the Robus network, "poking" a node is done by a physical line called PTP, connected between one node to another. Those lines are only used during the topology detection process.

Here is a complete detection process. As you can see, during the `node_ID` assignation, the PTP lines are moving. Using this measure meant we can know which node is where in the network.

The example below shows the different line states during the steps needed to poke and get a response back from the poked node. The PTP line is shared by two nodes, so both of them will have an impact on the line level.

This drawing represents the different states of the different nodes, and the line level resulting in those different states.
