# Robus introduction

[Robus](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/tree/main/network/robus) is the historical Luos engine's network. It has been developed to work natively with Luos engine, using its message structure as a protocol base to route messages.

This protocol has been developed specifically for the need of Luos engine and provides a good data bandwidth for a low memory footprint, a controlled RAM consumption, and a small CPU need.

Robus have been designed to be highly deterministic, real-time, and usable with a low-cost and compact network. Check [this page](/docs/next/hardware-consideration/minimum-requirements) for more information.
