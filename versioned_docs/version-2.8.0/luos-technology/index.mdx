# Luos Technology

## The most for the developer

Luos provides a simple way to think your hardware products as a group of independant features. You can easily manage and share your hardware products' features with your team, external developers, or with the community.
Luos engine is an <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">open-source lightweight library</a> that can be used on any [MCU](/docs/next/compatibility/mcu_demoboard), leading to free and fast multi-electronic-boards products development. Choosing Luos to design a product will help you to develop, debug, validate, monitor, and manage it from the cloud.

## The most for the community

Most of the embedded developments are made from scratch. By using Luos engine, you will be able to capitalize on the development you, your company, or the Luos community already did. The re-usability of features encapsulated in Luos engine [services](./services/index.mdx) will fasten the time your products reach the market and reassure the robustness and the universality of your applications.

We created a community on <a href="https://discord.gg/luos" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Discord</a> to create exchanges among developers from around the world. This allows anyone to share their projects, needs and ideas for developing edge and embedded projects. Everyone is welcome to join:
