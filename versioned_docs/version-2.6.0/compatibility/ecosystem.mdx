# Luos ecosystem

This page provides you with the different tools' compatibility information in the Luos ecosystem, and with the compatibility information between different versions of Luos engine in a same network.

## Ecosystem Compatibility

Luos provides several open source tools and API. Below is described the compatibility of Luos engine's versions with Luos HAL's and Pyluos' versions.

### How to read a compatibility table?

A compatibility table shows the compatibility of one version of a tool with other tools' versions. You read from left to right.

:::tip
Example:

| Luos engine | Luos HAL |         PYLUOS         |
| :---------: | :------: | :--------------------: |
|    2.0.0    | ≥ 0.4.0  | ≥ 2.0.0 <br /> < 2.0.2 |

In this extract of a table, we can read that Luos engine 2.0.0 is compatible with Luos HAL 0.4.0 and upper versions, and with versions of Pyluos between 2.0.0 (included) and 2.0.2 (not included).

## Tools Compatibility with Luos engine

### From version 2.4.0 of Luos engine

From version 2.4.0 of Luos engine, Luos HAL is included into Luos engine's repository, making them automatically compatible. In the table below, Luos HAL is implicitely included into Luos engine.

|    2.4.0    | ≥ 2.1.0 |

### Before version 2.4.0 of Luos engine

Before version 2.4.0 of Luos engine, Luos HAL's repository was separated from Luos engine's repository. The table below includes the compatibility with Luos HAL for versions older than 2.4.0.

| Luos engine | Luos HAL |         PYLUOS         |
| :---------: | :------: | :--------------------: |
|    2.3.0    |  0.5.3   |        ≥ 2.1.0         |
|    2.2.0    | ≥ 0.5.0  |        ≥ 2.0.3         |
|    2.1.0    | ≥ 0.5.0  |        ≥ 2.0.3         |
|    2.0.1    | ≥ 0.4.1  |        ≥ 2.0.2         |
|    2.0.0    | ≥ 0.4.0  | ≥ 2.0.0 <br /> < 2.0.2 |
|    1.3.0    | ≥ 0.3.0  | ≥ 1.5.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 |
|    1.2.0    | ≥ 0.3.0  | ≥ 1.4.2 <br /> < 2.0.0 |
|    1.1.1    | ≥ 0.2.0  | ≥ 1.3.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 |
|    1.1.0    | ≥ 0.2.0  | ≥ 1.3.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 |
|    1.0.1    | ≥ 0.2.0  | ≥ 1.3.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 |
|    1.0.0    | ≥ 0.1.0  | ≥ 1.3.0 <br /> < 2.0.0 |

## Network compatibility

In a same network, nodes can have different versions of Luos engine. The main rule is that all the minor versions in a same major version are compatible.

:::tip
For example, a node with the version 1.3.0 and a node with the version 1.2.0 are compatible because they have the same major version (in this example, version 1).
:::

:::warning
Despite this compatibility, some bugs may exist if you use different minor versions of a same major version. We advise you to use the same version of Luos engine in every nodes of a network.
