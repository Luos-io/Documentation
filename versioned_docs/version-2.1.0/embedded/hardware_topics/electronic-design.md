# Integrating Luos into an electronic board

To create and match with a default reference design, electronic boards must respect some design rules in order to properly work in a Luos network.

## Electronic design

Board examples and electronic sources are available <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/Examples/tree/master/Projects" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. You are free to use them as you want.

You can find the schematic of a Luos-ready board called L0 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" target="_blank">on Github</a> for a quick hardware example.

A Luos-friendly electronic board must contain _at least_ the following elements:

- **1** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" target="_blank">**MCU**</a> (microcontroller unit): It hosts, as a node, the Luos firmware along with the different <span className="cust_tooltip">services<span className="cust_tooltiptext">{{service_def}}</span></span> (drivers and apps).
- **At least 2 connectors**: They allow to link boards together into a Luos network as a daisy-chain. Through PTP pins, nodes know if there is another node connected to the connector. This is used when the user wants to make a topology detection of the system.

## One-wire reference design

## RS485 reference design

## Compatible MCUs

Luos can manage any type of microcontrollers as long as they are first added to the library manually. If your microcontroller is not supported yet, please contact us:

## PTP

Peer-to-peer connection between nodes for topology detection.

### Daisy-chain

With 2 PTP pins per board, you must chained you device as below:

### Star Mounting

With at least 3 PTP pins per board, you can create a star mounting configuration:
