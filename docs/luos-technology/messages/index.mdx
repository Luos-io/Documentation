# Messages

As a developer, you will have to create and use Luos messages to exchange information between <Tooltip def={customFields.service_def}>services</Tooltip>. In order to do that, you have to understand how messages work.

## Message structure

Luos engine's messages are managed by the `msg_t` structure:

```c
typedef struct{
    header_t header;
    uint8_t data[MAX_DATA_MSG_SIZE];
}msg_t;
```

All messages have a header. A header is a 7-byte field containing all information allowing services to understand the messages' context. All services in the network catch and decode the header of each sent and received message.

`data` is a table containing data.

> **Info:** MAX_DATA_MSG_SIZE represents the maximum size of messages (default value is 128 bytes);

## Header

To send data to any services you want, you will have to first fill out some information on the header.

here is the `header_t` structure:

```c
typedef struct{
    uint16_t protocol : 4;    /*!< Protocol version. */
    uint16_t target : 12;     /*!< Target address, it can be (ID, Topic,Broadcast, Type). */
    uint16_t target_mode : 4; /*!< Select targeting mode (ID, ID+ACK, Topic, Broadcast, Type). */
    uint16_t source : 12;     /*!< Source address, it can be (ID, Topic, Broadcast, Type). */
    uint8_t cmd;              /*!< msg definition. */
    uint16_t size;            /*!< Size of the data field. */
}header_t;
```

- **Protocol (4 bits)**: This field provides the protocol revision. This field is automatically filled; you don't have to deal with it.
- **Target (12 bits)**: This field contains the target address. To understand the real destination of this field, you have to know the addressing mode contained on the _Target_mode_ field.
- **Target_mode (4 bits)**: This field indicates the addressing mode and how to understand the _Target_ field. It can take different values:
  - **SERVICEID**: This mode allows to communicate with a unique service using its ID **without** acknowledgment return.
  - **SERVICEIDACK**: This mode allows to communicate with a unique service using its ID **with** acknowledgment return.
  - **TYPE**: This mode sends a message to all services with a given type, e.g. all "Sharp digital distance sensor".
  - **BROADCAST**: This mode allows all the services in the network to catch a message. In this case, the message contains a type of data used by multiple services.
  - **TOPIC**: Publisher/Subscriber mode, allows multiple services to catch a message depending on the topic that they subscribed to. 
  - **NODEID**: This mode allows to send a message to all the services of a specific node **without** acknowledgment return.
  - **NODEIDACK**: This mode allows to send a message to all the services of a specific node **with** acknowledgment return.
- **Source (12 bits)**: The unique ID of the transmitter service.
- **CMD (8 bits)**: The command defines the transmitted data's type.
- **Size (16 bits)**: Size of the incoming data.
- **ACK (8 bits)**: [Acknowledgment](../../tools/monitoring) signal demanded in target modes **IDACK** and **NODEIDACK**, after the good reception of the message.
