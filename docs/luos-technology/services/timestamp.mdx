# Timestamp

**Timestamp** is a feature that enables you to track the date at which an event occurs.

For example with a button driver: each time we read the button's state, we want to timestamp this event. To do that, we have to save a time information representing our timestamp.

```C
#include "timestamp.h"

time_luos_t button_timestamp;
```

Then we can save our timestamp's date when we read the state of the button:

```C
ll_button_read(&button.state);
button_timestamp = Timestamp_now();
```

After retrieving the timestamp's value, you can do some calculation on it. For example, you can include a constant delay before measurement, or add a specific amount of time to manage future timestamp's date.

Then you can send a message with your button's value using `Luos_SendTimestampMsg`:

```C
Luos_SendTimestampMsg(button_service, button_msg, button_timestamp);
```

All **timestamp** API functions can be found in _Luos_engine/engine/core/inc/timestamp.h_. You can also find [examples](https://github.com/Luos-io/Examples/blob/master/Projects/l0/) that are using this feature. The examples using timestamp are:

- distance,
- light sensor,
- potentiometer.

| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------: |
|     Get the present timestamp     |         `Timestamp_now(void);`          | `time_luos_t` |
| Check if a message is timestamped | `Timestamp_IsTimestampMsg(msg_t *msg);` |    `bool`     |
|      Get a message timestamp      |  `Timestamp_GetTimestamp(msg_t *msg);`  | `time_luos_t` |
