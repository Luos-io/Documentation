# My board is not detected in the network

### Symptom(s)

After flashing a board with PlatformIO and launching a detection, the board is not detected in the Luos network.

### Possible reason(s)

- The upload function did not work properly in PlatformIO.

### Explanation and resolution

Sometimes, VS Code and PlatformIO do not clean nor regenerate the user folders _.vscode_ and _.pio_, and it can affect uploading (or flashing) your code to the board, even if there is a success message after the upload. The clean action does not affect these folders either.

If you have this detection problem, try the following actions:

- Delete the folder _.pio_ from the tree on the left in PLatformIO.
- In order to have a clean development environment, you can also delete the folder _.vscode_ from the tree.
- Perform a clean (Bin icon in the bottom left of VS Code).
- Try hitting Upload again in the bottom left.

The deleted folders and their files will be automatically regenerated at upload. Then try to make a detection again, the board should now be detected.

### Example

#### Step 1: Delete the folders

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/assets/images/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-01.png" />
</div>

#### Step 2: Clean and upload your code

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/assets/images/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-02.png" />
</div>

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/assets/images/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-03.png" />
</div>

:::note
The uplaod time may be longer, because the files are regenerated in the folders _.vscode_ and _.pio_.
