# I can't complete the get started tutorial because some dependencies are not installed

### Symptom(s)

When you start your first application or follow the Luos's get started you may face problems with the environment development installation. This topic explains and guides you through the installation process of these dev tools.

### Possible explanation

- Python installation
- Pip install
- VSCODE installation
- PlateformIO installation

### Resolution

If you have a problem setting up your environment development, check the following parts where you may have been stuck and install the related dependencies. You may need to uninstall all the firmware above and reinstall them one by one following step by step.

### Example

#### Python 3 Installation

For MacOS and Linux Python is pre install following installation for Windows

##### Step 1: Download Python 3 Executable Installer

1. Go to the Downloads for Windows section of the official Python website.
2. Search for your desired version of Python (version 3.7.3 or higher)
3. Select a link to download either the Windows x86-64 executable

</div>

Note: If your Windows installation is a 32-bit system, you need the Windows x86 executable installer. If your Windows is a 64-bit version, you need to download the Windows x86-64 executable installer. There is nothing to worry about if you install the “wrong” version. You can uninstall one version of Python and install another.

##### Step 2: Run Executable Installer

1. Run the Python Installer once downloaded. (In this example, we have downloaded Python 3.7.3.)
2. Make sure you select the Install launcher for all users and Add Python 3 to PATH checkboxes.
3. Select Install Now

</div>

For all recent versions of Python, the recommended installation options include Pip and IDLE. Older versions might not include such additional features.

4. The next dialog will prompt you to select whether to Disable path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit. Effectively, it will enable Python to use long path names.

</div>

The Disable path length limit option will not affect any other system settings. Turning it on will resolve potential name length issues that may arise with Python projects developed in Linux.

#### Installing PIP

Follow the steps outlined below to install PIP on Windows.

##### Step 1: Download PIP get-pip.py

Before installing PIP, download the get-pip.py file.

1. Launch a command prompt if it isn't already open. To do so, open the Windows search bar, type cmd and click on the icon.
2. Then, run the following command to download the get-pip.py file:
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

</div>

##### Step 2: Installing PIP on Windows

To install PIP type in the following:
python get-pip.py

</div>

If the file isn't found, double-check the path to the folder where you saved the file.

#### Installing VSCode

1. Download the Visual Studio Code installer for your OS.

</div>

For Windows:

2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
3. By default, VS Code is installed under C:\users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.

#### Installing PlatformIO on VSCode

1. Open VSCode Extension Manager
2. Search for official PlateforIO IDE extension
3. Install PlatformIO IDE.
