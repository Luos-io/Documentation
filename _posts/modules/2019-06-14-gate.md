# Introduction to the {{ module }} module type

The {{ module }} module allows to translate Json to Luos and Luos to Json constantly. This module continuously pulls data from the sensors detected on the network and streams it into a Json format. Also, it can receive Json data and convert it into a module command.

You need to have at least one of these modules in one of your nodes to use the Luos network with a computer using Pyluos or any other lib.

Json is a really mainstream standard allowing you to use your favorite language easily trough a Json library.

The {{ module }} module type has access to all common capabilities.
