# Part 2: Include Luos to your project

## 1. Include the Luos lib in your project

The file *platformio.ini* in your project describes the precompiler variables and the library depencies of your project.

In our case, we want to use Luos as a library. Writing "Luos" and "LuosHAL" in the section `lib_deps` will download the Luos library from PIO registry and will build and link Luos to your project.

Fill in the file *platformio.ini* accordingly:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

```c
build_unflags = -Os
build_flags =
		-O1
    -include node_config.h
    -DUSE_HAL_DRIVER
    -DUSE_FULL_LL_DRIVER
    -DLUOSHAL=STM32F0
lib_deps =
    luos_engine
debug_tool = stlink
upload_protocol = stlink
```

At the line `LUOSHAL=STM32F0`, we selected Luos HAL for the chosen MCU family (as we use the board STM32F072Rb, it means it is the STM32F0 family).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">

```c
build_unflags = -Os
build_flags =
		-O1
    -include node_config.h
    -DUSE_HAL_DRIVER
    -DUSE_FULL_LL_DRIVER
    -DLUOSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO
lib_deps =
    luos_engine
```

At the line `LUOSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO`, we selected Luos HAL for the chosen MCU family (as we use the board Arduino MKRZero, it means it is the ATSAMD21_ARDUINO family).


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
You can fix a minimal version that you want for your Library:
`Luos@^X.Y.Z` → Minimal version of Luos (writing nothing here will download the last version).
`LuosHAL@^X.Y.Z` → Minimal version of LuosHAL (writing nothing here will download the last version).
:::

## 2. Include Luos in your main file

At the top of the main file, add `#include "Luos.h".` With this line, you added Luos Library to your project so that you can use Luos API.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

```c
#include "stm32f0xx_hal.h"
#include "luos_engine.h"

...

int main(void)
{
    // Init
    HAL_Init();
		Luos_Init();

    // Loop
    while (1)
    {
			Luos_Loop();
    }
}

...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">

```c
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "luos_engine.h"

void setup()
{
  Luos_Init();
}

void loop()
{
  Luos_Loop();
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Luos library, and future Luos packages that you will create, have two special functions: `Init()` and `Loop()`.

-Init function is called once, at MCU reset.
-Loop function will be called sequentially in a loop.

:::info
Each API begins with the name of the file where it is declared. A simple rule of coding, but very convenient.
:::

## 3. Include Luos PTP interruption

In the case that you have a network, you need a way to detect other MCUs in this network. with Luos network, we use two pins (see the documentation page [topology and network](/docs/luos-technology/node/topology) for more information).

Those special pins called PTP are necessary for the topology detection. They need an interruption handler to work on a Luos network.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

1. Open the file *stm32xx_it.c*
2. fill in at the end of the file with the following code:

```c
/******************************************************************************/
/* STM32F0xx Peripheral Interrupt Handlers                                    */
/* Add here the Interrupt Handlers for the used peripherals.                  */
/* For the available peripheral interrupt handler names,                      */
/* please refer to the startup file (startup_stm32f0xx.s).                    */
/******************************************************************************/
void EXTI4_15_IRQHandler(void)
{
  HAL_GPIO_EXTI_IRQHandler(GPIO_PIN_8);
  HAL_GPIO_EXTI_IRQHandler(GPIO_PIN_13);

}
```

:::info
This is the default configuration of F0 Family used for the STM32F072RB (see [*LuosHAL_Config.h*](https://github.com/Luos-io/LuosHAL)). If you need to adapt you hardware, put your changes in the file *node_config.h* in your project.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">
For Arduino, Luos fills in this information for you.

:::warning
You have to follow the pinout declared in the file *LuosHAL_Config.h* for ATSAMD21_ARDUINO in the [LuosHAL repository](https://github.com/Luos-io/LuosHAL).
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. Compile your Luos project

As you can see in the terminal when you build your project, PlatformiIO will download the last version of the Luos library from its registry, and add it as a library to your project.

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/img/tutorials/pio/pio-2-1.png" />
</div>

Upload the code to your MCU by clicking on the right arrow button at the bottom of the IDE.

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/img/tutorials/pio/pio-2-2.png" />
</div>

You have now created a project with an ST framework or with an Arduino framework, and configured evreyting to begin with Luos.

Rename your project and add packages like in the trainings, in order to make great projects with Luos! [You check this solution](https://github.com/Luos-io/Mooc/tree/main/Basic_Project).
