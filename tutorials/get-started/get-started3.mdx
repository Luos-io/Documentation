## 1. Introduction

The first two parts of the [Get started tutorial](/tutorials/get-started) are now done. Good work! üí™

In this part, we will learn how to configure Luos engine to access to multiple boards in your physical network. Then, we will run our first example into these boards.

:::info
We will use the same board from the first two parts, but **you also need a second board to create a network**. Supported boards are listed [here](/tutorials/get-started#setup-development-environment).

:::

## 2. Create a physical network
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Board" label="Board">

As we saw in Part 1, Luos engine allows you to define services and use them together on one MCU. What really sets Luos apart and makes it special is that you can also make services work together on separated MCUs.

Let's make a network with two boards!

In this part, we will use the ‚Äúdefault wiring‚Äù defined by Luos to create a network of two MCUs. We will use a [OneWire network](/docs/hardware-consideration/electronics), limiting the circuit to simple wires and pins:

- Tx and Rx pins, which are connected together and wired to the Tx and Rx pins of the other board (see the next image).
- One PTP wire.

:::tip
üí° Luos Point-To-Point (PTP) connection allows you to find your board's [physical position](/docs/luos-technology/node/topology). Luos engine can deal with up to 8 PTP lines on each board to connect as many boards as you want.

:::

:::caution
To prevent any mistakes, unplug the USB cables from the boards before wiring.

    darkSrc="/assets/images/tutorials/get-started/get-started-3-dark.png"
  />
</div>

To create your network, you have to identify the pins used to perform Luos communication:

| Function name | Arduino pin | STM32L432KC pin | STM32F072RB pin | STM32F401RE pin | STM32F410RB pin | STM32G431KB pin | Seeeduino XIAO pin | ESP32 WROOM 32 Dev Kit |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| TX            | Tx          | PA9 (D0)        | PA9 (D8)        | PB7(21)         | PB7 (21)        | PA9 (D0)        | D6                 | Tx (SD2)               |
| RX            | Rx          | PA10 (D1)       | PA10 (D2)       | PB6 (D10)       | PB6 (D10)       | PA10 (D1)       | D7                 | Rx (SD3)               |
| PTP           | D6          | PB5 (D12)       | PA8 (D7)        | PB5 (D5)        | PB5 (D5)        | PB5 (D12)       | D1                 | IO26                   |

Below are the schematics of various boards and how to wire them:

You should now be able to wire the two boards together. From now on, we will call these boards _board 1_ and _board 2_.

:::warning
After wiring the boards together, you will have to power both of them for the network to work correctly. In the next steps of this tutorial, _board 1_ will already be plugged to the computer with the USB cable. To power _board 2_, you can either connect the power output pin of _board 1 (5V pin)_ to the power input pin of _board 2 (Vin pin)_, or simply plug _board 2_ to another USB cable so that both boards are powered by the computer. **In the first case, do not forget to wire the GND pins together on both boards.**

:::

## 3. Build a Luos distributed system

In Part 1, you have downloaded or cloned the Get started code folder in your computer. We will use this code to demonstrate how Luos engine works using a network. We will begin by moving the blinker app service from _board 1_ to _board 2_ and see what happens next.

### Flash _board 1_

:::caution
Connect the USB cable of _board 1_ and leave the USB cable of _board 2_ disconnected.

:::

1. In VS Code, open the folder _Get_started_ that corresponds to your _board 1_: `file/open folder`.
2. From the left panel, locate and open the file _src/main.c_ or _src/Arduino.ino_.
3. Comment the following two lines to remove the blinker service from this board: `Blinker_Init();` and `Blinker_Loop();`

   ```c
   ...
       Luos_Init();
       Led_Init();
       Pipe_Init();
       Gate_Init();
       //Blinker_Init(); <== comment this line
   ...
       Luos_Loop();
       Led_Loop();
       Pipe_Loop();
       Gate_Loop();
       //Blinker_Loop(); <== comment this line
   ```

:::info
These lines trigger the initialization and looping execution of all the packages in your project.

:::

4. Check whether the proper board environnement is selected depending on your board:

<div align="center">
  <Image
    src="/assets/images/tutorials/get-started/get-started-3-6_light.png"
    darkSrc="/assets/images/tutorials/get-started/get-started-3-6-dark.png"
  />
</div>
5. Build and flash _board 1_ by clicking on the arrow pointing to the right on the bottom left in VS
Code.

### Flash _board 2_

:::caution
You should now unplug the USB cable of _board 1_ and connect the USB cable of _board 2_.

:::

1. In VS Code, open the folder _Get_started_ project corresponding to your _board 2_, `file/open folder`. (If you have the same boards twice, you can open the same folder.)
2. From the left panel, find and open the file _src/main.c_ (or _src/Arduino.ino_ for Arduino users).
3. This time, comment the following six lines to remove all of the services except the blinker: `Led_Init();`, `Pipe_Init();`, `Gate_Init();`, `Led_Loop();`, `Pipe_Loop();`, and `Gate_Loop();`

   ```c
   ...
       Luos_Init();
       //Led_Init(); <== comment this line
       //Pipe_Init(); <== comment this line
       //Gate_Init(); <== comment this line
       Blinker_Init();
   ...
       Luos_Loop();
       //Led_Loop(); <== comment this line
       //Pipe_Loop(); <== comment this line
       //Gate_Loop(); <== comment this line
       Blinker_Loop();
   ```

:::tip
In order to keep using Luos engine in your MCU, don't comment `Luos_init()` nor `Luos_Loop()`.

:::

4. Check if the right board environment is selected depending on your board:

<div align="center">
  <Image
    src="/assets/images/tutorials/get-started/get-started-3-7.png"
    darkSrc="/assets/images/tutorials/get-started/get-started-3-7.png"
  />
</div>
5. Build and flash _board 2_ by clicking on the arrow pointing to the right on the bottom left in VS
Code.

We are done!

To check if everything is OK, plug a USB cable into _board 1,_ and power _board 2_ according to your previous choice (power pins from _board 1_ or USB cable from computer).

The LED of _board 1_ should blink thanks to the blinker app in _board 2_.

**Congratulation, you've just created your first Luos distributed system. The objective of this part of our Get started was to use a service located in your first board, in another board to perform an action on it.**

## 4. Use Pyluos to control your network

You can now use `pyluos-shell` in your terminal, as we did in Part 2. You should see the following:

```bash
**$ pyluos-shell**
Searching for a gate available

As we saw in Part 1, Luos engine allows you to define services and use them together on one program. What really sets Luos apart and makes it special is that you can also make services work together on separated programs.

In Part 1, you have downloaded or cloned the Get started code folder in your computer. We will use this code to demonstrate how Luos engine works using a network.
To create a link between multiple programs on your computer Luos will use WebSockets to exchange information instead of a serial communication between electronic boards.

To be able to do that, you need to run a broker that will share any transmitted message with all other programs.

This broker is a simple python script, to make it run you need to install simple_websocket_server:

```
pip install simple_websocket_server==0.4.2
```

Then you can run the broker script on `Get_started/No-Board/`:

```bash
python broker.py
```

:::info
By default the broker will use localhost IP address.
If you want to experiment it using multiple computers you can configure your IP and port:
```bash
python broker.py --ip 'YOUR_LOCAL_IP' -p 8000
```
:::


## 3. Build a Luos distributed system

We will begin by moving the blinker app service from _board 1_ to _board 2_ and see what happens next.

### Run _board 1_

1. In VS Code, open the folder _Get_started/No-Board_: `file/open folder`.
2. From the left panel, locate and open the file _src/main.c_.
3. Comment the following two lines to remove the blinker service from this board: `Blinker_Init();` and `Blinker_Loop();`

   ```c
   ...
       Luos_Init();
       Led_Init();
       Pipe_Init();
       Gate_Init();
       //Blinker_Init(); <== comment this line
   ...
       Luos_Loop();
       Led_Loop();
       Pipe_Loop();
       Gate_Loop();
       //Blinker_Loop(); <== comment this line
   ```

:::info
These lines trigger the initialization and looping execution of all the packages in your project.
:::
:::info
By default the program will use localhost IP address.
If you want to experiment it using multiple computers you can set the broker IP and port on the node_config.h file by replacing #define WS_BROKER_ADDR "ws://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000" with the correct IP and port.
:::

4. Build  the project.

:::info
Windows users must install a specific 64 bits version of GCC to compile the no board projects.
For example, the current version has been tested with MinGW-w64 (MSVCRT runtime). This library can be downloaded on https://winlibs.com/

:::

5. On a new terminal run the compiled binary:
```bash
./.pio/build/native/program
```

### Run _board 2_

1. In VS Code, open the same folder _Get_started/No-Board_: `file/open folder`.
2. From the left panel, find and open the file _src/main.c_.
3. This time, comment the following six lines to remove all of the services except the blinker: `Led_Init();`, `Pipe_Init();`, `Gate_Init();`, `Led_Loop();`, `Pipe_Loop();`, and `Gate_Loop();`

   ```c
   ...
       Luos_Init();
       //Led_Init(); <== comment this line
       //Pipe_Init(); <== comment this line
       //Gate_Init(); <== comment this line
       Blinker_Init();
   ...
       Luos_Loop();
       //Led_Loop(); <== comment this line
       //Pipe_Loop(); <== comment this line
       //Gate_Loop(); <== comment this line
       Blinker_Loop();
   ```

:::tip
In order to keep using Luos engine in your program, don't comment `Luos_init()` nor `Luos_Loop()`.
:::

4. Build  the project.
5. On a new terminal run the compiled binary:
```bash
./.pio/build/native/program
```

We are done!

To check if everything is OK, the LED displayed on the terminal running _board 1_ should blink thanks to the blinker app in _board 2_.

**Congratulation, you've just created your first Luos distributed system. The objective of this part of our Get started was to use a service located in your first program, in another board to perform an action on it.**

## 4. Use Pyluos to control your network

You can now use `pyluos-shell -p 'localhost'` in your terminal, as we did in Part 2. You should see the following:

```bash
**$ pyluos-shell -p 'localhost'**

Connected to "localhost".
Sending detection signal.
Waiting for routing table...

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
As we can see, the blinker application is now displayed on a separate board. You still can control and interact with services on both boards with pyluos, as we did in Part 2.

For example, with your network connected to the computer, follow the step 3 from Part 2 and try to execute these lines one by one in an IPython session:

1. Set up the blinking timing to 250ms (you should see the LED blink faster):

```
device.blinker.time=0.25
```

2. Pause the blinking of the LED:

```
device.blinker.pause()
```

3. Turn on the LED:

```
device.led.state=True
```

4. Turn off the LED:

```
device.led.state=False
```

5. Restart the blinking of the LED:

```
device.blinker.play()
```

## 5. Next steps

In the next part of the Get started tutorial, we'll use the default network used by the Luos engine called Robus. The customization of your physical interface will be addressed in a future tutorial. The default hardware interface used by Robus is defined on the <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/tree/main/network/robus/HAL" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Robus HAL</a> folder corresponding to your device.

## 6. Test your skills

<Form id="FV0qhGbo" />

**Congratulation, you have plugged, configured, and used your first Luos network!**

The next step will show you how to visualize your network online through the Luos Network Display tool.

You can check out our [tutorials](/tutorials) to learn more about Luos and understand how to use the features of Luos engine. We also invite you to check out our [documentation](/docs/luos-technology) to learn more about the core concepts of Luos engine.
