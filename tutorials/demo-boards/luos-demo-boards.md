# A general guide to Luos electronic boards

Luos library has been designed to run on low-cost hardware. It works with all Arm microcontrollers, starting with the smallest and cheapest one: the Cortex-M0.

The demonstration boards are a set of small electronic boards examples, each hosting Luos and providing an electronic function (motor, distance sensor, battery, LED, potentiometer, etc.). These boards can be used to test the technology or to quickly develop an electronic device prototype in order to prove a concept without any knowledge in electronics: demonstration boards are connected with cables, behaviors can be programmed through a gate board on a computer, and the device can be tested in a matter of minutes!

Luos provides simple electronic boards examples to build in order to demonstrate the Luos modular technology. These examples are available on Github and contain a schematic file and a Kicad file so that they can be easily reproduced to test Luos.

## Boards general specifications

Almost every demonstration board in the provided examples is composed of a motherboard and a shield board. The motherboard, called L0, has a <Tooltip def={customFields.node_def}>node</Tooltip> that hosts Luos. The shield board is added to an L0 to type it with an electronic function.

:::caution
Power category boards don't include an L0 motherboard as they provide only power functions and don't need communication. However. The communication data passes through their connectors to other communicating boards.

Here are the specifications of this motherboard:

---

- Board name: L0
- MCU: STM32f0
- Dimensions: 20 x 26 mm
- Supply Voltage: 5 V to 24 V
- Output Voltage: 5 V
- Connectors: 2x Robus connectors (<a href="https://octopart.com/df11-8dp-2ds%2824%29-hirose-39521447" target="_blank">_DF11-8DP-2DS(24)<IconExternalLink width="10" />_</a>)
- Sockets: 2x 6 connectors (<a href="https://octopart.com/826926-3-te+connectivity-40939547" target="_blank">_826926-3<IconExternalLink width="10" />_</a>)
- Other Output: 1x micro-USB
- USB Serial Speed: 1 Mbaud/s

## Plugging boards together

Luos boards have at least two connection ports in their design. All connectors are the same so that any board can be connected to another using any of these ports. Just avoid making a loop circuit, otherwise you will inhibit communication between services.

There is a right side to plug a cable's connector to a board. The small tab on the connector must face upward to plug correctly, as shown on the following pictures:

| ![Wrong side img](/img/plug-no.png)   | ![Right side img](/img/plug-yes.png)                |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Wrong side, the upper surface is flat | Right side, the tab is visible on the upper surface |

## Power management

Luos boards can share their power inputs through the network connection, allowing you to feed other boards. These boards belong to the **power category**.
All the Luos boards can manage a voltage between 5 V and 24 V, up to 7 A.

In a Luos network, **you can have multiple power category boards**. In this case, **the power board with the highest voltage takes over** and shares its power with other boards.

For example, for a device using a 12 V motor and a USB board, the USB board belongs to the power category; so it shares its 5 V into the network's wires. Still, you need 12 V for your motor, so you will have to add a 12 V AC plugboard in your network to supply the motor. In this case, the USB board doesn't share its power; only the AC plugboard does, because 5 V is inferior to 12 V.

Some components need a specific voltage to work correctly. For example, to use a standard servomotor, you have to feed the Luos network with 5 V or 7 V. If you need to combine 7 V and 12 V motors in a system, for example, you can manage multiple voltages on the same network using a power isolator board.

## External communication management

The boards from the Communication category allow you to control a Luos network easily. These boards host a service called "gate", they can communicate using different kinds of technologies and reach devices outside the device.

To start using Luos technology, you have to use at least one of these gates to be able to program your machine's behaviors.

The "gate" service's task is to stream the Luos network activity into a standard JSON format file, and on the opposite to allow an external device to easily interact with any device in the network.

This way, it is **easy to use** your favorite device and language to interact and control your device.

We created an open-source **Python library** managing this JSON API called Pyluos. Feel free to use it, copy it, and convert it into your favorite language. We are open to review your contributions in any programming languages.
