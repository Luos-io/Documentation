# Part 1: Receiving a message

## 1. Introduction

A button can be represented (as a LED) by a state-type service. But contrary to the LED, the button will have to send a state value instead of receiving it.

A button service only has to manage a button, so it is kind of dumb! Your button service doesn't know where it needs to send its value, that's why you will have to program a reaction from an external request.

Your button service will have to receive a request message asking for the state of the button, then the service will have to send the state's value back to the asking service.

    darkSrc="/img/your-first-message/your-first-message-1-dark.png"
    alt="your first message"
  />
</div>

## 2. Callback vs. polling

Since the [Create a package](/tutorials/your-first-service/create-a-package) tutorial, you know how to create a service into a package with a callback.

But Luos engine's services have in fact two different ways to receive messages: callback and polling.

- Asynchronous reception (Callback)
  <div align="center">
    <Image
      src="/img/your-first-message/your-first-message-1-1.png"
      darkSrc="/img/your-first-message/your-first-message-1-1-dark.png"
      alt="async reception"
    />
  </div>

In the callback option, you give to Luos engine a shipping address (called a message handler) allowing it to just deliver the message to your service. Your service needs to be ready to receive and handle the message directly.

- Synchronous reception (Polling)
  <div align="center">
    <Image
      src="/img/your-first-message/your-first-message-1-2.png"
      darkSrc="/img/your-first-message/your-first-message-1-2-dark.png"
      alt="sync reception"
    />
  </div>

In the polling option, Luos engine doesn't know the shipping address, so your service will have to check if Luos engine has a messages available, and then get it if there is one.
Your service can get a message whenever it wants to.

In this tutorial, we will create a service without any callback to explore the polling option.

In PlatformIO IDE, open the folder corresponding to your board in `Training/1_First_Service/Work_base` from the repository you just cloned or downloaded, and connect the board to your computer with a USB cable.

## 3. Create a button service

You can create your service in the button package's `Init` function, but this time do not write any callback in the first argument and put a `0` value instead:

```c
void Button_Init(void)
{
    // the two new lines to copy and paste
    revision_t revision = {1, 0, 0};
    Luos_CreateService(0, STATE_TYPE, "button", revision);
}

void Button_Loop(void){}
```

Because you did not give any shipping address to Luos engine, your service will have to go get it by itself.

We only need two functions here, called `Button_Init()` and `Button_loop()`.

Let's try it!

1. Compile and upload the project to the board.
2. Use `pyluos-shell` in a terminal. You should see the following routing table:

```bash
  ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
  ┃  ╭node 1            /!\ Not certified            ┃
  ┃  │  Type                Alias               ID   ┃
  ┃  ├> Pipe                Pipe                2    ┃
  ┃  ├> Gate                gate                1    ┃
  ┃  ╰> State               button              3    ┃
╔>┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

</div>

## 4. Handle a request using the polling method

To pull messages from Luos engine, we will need to know which service is asking for them. To do that, you need to create a `service_t` pointer, so that at the service creation Luos engine would allow you to link it to the actual created service:

```c
/*******************************************************************************
 * Variable
 ******************************************************************************/
// the new line to copy and paste
service_t *button_service;
```

Assign the variable to your service creation:

```c
void Button_Init(void)
{
  // the two new lines to copy and paste
  revision_t revision = {1, 0, 0};
  button_service = Luos_CreateService(0, STATE_TYPE, "button", revision);
}
```

Because we do not give any message handler to Luos engine, we will have to get the available messages into the service loop function using `Luos_ReadMsg` function:

```c
void Button_Loop(void)
{
  // the new block to copy and paste
  msg_t* msg;
  if (Luos_ReadMsg(button_service, &msg) == SUCCEED)
  {
    // We get a message!
  }
}
```

If we enter into this `if` condition, that tells us we have received a message and that we can deal with it.

To be able to send back the button value, we now need to check if the received message is a proper request:

```c
void Button_Loop(void)
{
		msg_t* msg;
		if (Luos_ReadMsg(button_service, &msg) == SUCCEED)
		{
        // the new line to copy and paste
				if ((msg->header.cmd == IO_STATE)||(msg->header.cmd == UNKNOW)
				{
		      // We will have to send our button info here
		    }
		}
}
```

As you can see in this message filtering, this request could be two different commands:

- A service can ask specifically for an `IO_STATE`.

- A service can ask for an UNKNOW value because it does not known the returned type of the value.

:::info
Sometimes, a service wants an `UNKNOW` type because it does not specifically know what the returned value will be an `IO_STATE` type. You can use it as a common way to get any kind of value from services.

Everything is ready for reception, we can now learn how to reply to the request and send a message!
